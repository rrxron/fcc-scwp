SQL
  = structured query language
  = universal relational database query language
  = always use "parameterized sql queries" to avoid SQL injection attacks

Database Model
  = database schema
  = structure or format of a database

Data Model
  = representation of objects and relationships in data
  = don't put the same string data in twice, use relationship
  = each data object that needs to be stored on db should exist

Database Normalization (3NF)
  = 3NF; third normal form
    reduce data duplication
    avoid data anomaly
    ensure referential integrity
    entity integrity = every row is uniquely identifiable
    simplify data management
  = use GUID as Primary Keys but NOT as a Clustering Key because they are not 100% sequential
    therefore there needs to be a dedicated column for the Clustering Key
    because Primary key is by default the Clustering Key as well
    so need to manually specify it

JOIN operation
  = select statement across multiple tables
  = "SELECT tbl1.col, tbl2.col ... FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2 ON tbl1.tbl2_fk = tbl2.pk"
  = "ON" indicates how the two tables are to be joined
  = can do "FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2 JOIN tbl3 ON tbl1.col = tbl2.col and tbl2.col = tbl3.col"

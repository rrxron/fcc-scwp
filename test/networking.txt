JSON & XML = common format in sending data over the internet


XML = eXtensible Markup Language
    = heirarchy structure with elements/nodes and parent/child relationships
    = ideal for hierarchical documents
XML Schema
    = W3C schema specification for XML
    = contract to validate if the format of XML is valid
    = uses XSD structure

python has an "xml" library to handle these


JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
     = ideal for transferring data

SOA = service oriented approach
    = allow application to be broken into parts and distributed accross network
    = example: webservice API hosted in the cloud that can be consumed

API = application program interface
    = used by web apps to give data to consumers of that service
    = can be secured by requiring consumers to use API keys via OAuth
    = rate limiting is used so that the service is not abused by allowing
      limited requests per day, sometimes it can be included in the response header
